# The idea

Extract possible chapters from subtitles of a video. For the purporse of this colab, we are going to use the "Machine Learning for Everybody" from freeCodeCamp.org:

# How to use it

1.   Upload your VTT caption file to the root of your colab environment with the name "captions.vtt"
2.   Run the code :)

# How to get a captions.vtt file

If you don't have the captions file yet, you can generate them at https://savesubs.com/ . Got to their sites, paste the youtube video URL in the main box and ask for download.
